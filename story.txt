Bill is a CS student, one day he is doing a programming assignment of CS 400. The code he writes cannot pass the final test on gradescope.

He tries everything but for the life of him can't figure out why part of his program gives the wrong results. Bill posts on Piazza, checks if others have had the same issues, and finally goes to lab hours to have someone else take a look at his work.

After hours of frustration and torment, Bill finally figured out that he forgot to put a semicolon after a line of code he wrote. He submitted his code to gradescope and got all 10 out of 10 points. Bill rejoiced with happiness and submitted his assignment a minute before it was due, then proceded to go to bed.
