Bill is a CS student, one day he is doing a programming assignment of CS 400. The code he writes cannot pass the final test on gradescope.

He tries everything but for the life of him can't figure out why part of his program gives the wrong results. Bill posts on Piazza, checks if others have had the same issues, and finally goes to lab hours to have someone else take a look at his work.

He went into the lab and found there was full of people. TAs were busy answering questions while trying to keep the order of the lab. Students were singing and laughing and chatting, and the place was very messy. Bill had to wait for a long time until the next TA becomes available. 

After hours of frustration and torment, Bill finally figured out that he forgot to put a semicolon after a line of code he wrote. He submitted his code to gradescope and got all 10 out of 10 points. Bill rejoiced with happiness and submitted his assignment a minute before it was due, then proceded to go to bed.

Bill has nightmare. In his dream, the Internet broke down at the very minute and he failed to submit it. He can do nothing but seeing the clock go to 00:00. He wakes up, with a fast heartbeat. After that, Bill decides not to do the assignment at the due date, but start when he get the time, as early as possible. At the next assignment, Bill starts the day right after the assignment is released. He struggles at the first place and really want to leave it for later. However, when he finishes, he feels good. Also, because he has plenty of time reviewing and polishing the code, every of his assignment receives high grade and he succeed in this course.
